# Understaning Algorithms
"""
An algorithm is a set of steps taken by a program to perform a task.

#Algorithmic Thinking
"""
In a real life senario we can use the game of thinking about a number and
letting someone try to predict the number we are thinking about, for example,
the number can be between 1 and 10, both 1 and 10 included. The steps that they
would take to get the correct number might vary from person to person because 
some might use steps that would get them to the correct answer quicker than others.

Some might start guesing the numbers from the beginning 1 and progress by adding 1 until
they get the correct number while some might start from a number in the middle say 5 then
determine how close they are to the correct number and adjust there thinking.

The one which will take fewer steps to the get to the correct answer is the winner as it is
the most effective strategy.

That is what is called algorithmic thinking.
"""

# Strategies used in the above example
"""
The strategies used in the above scenario are examples of search algorithms. The strategy
of starting from the beginning and adding one number after the other is called linear search
or sequential search or just simple search.
"""

# Example of an Algorithm (Linear Search)
"""
Linear search is defined by having a list of items with our target items amongst them then we start
to search for it from the beginnig of the list, progress through the list until we either find the
item we are searching for or run out of items.
"""

# What should an Algorithm be
"""
1. Clearly defined problem statement, input and output.
2. The steps in the algorith need to be in a very specific order
3. The steps also need to be distinct
4. The algorithm should produce a result.
5. The algorithm should complete in a finit amount of time.
