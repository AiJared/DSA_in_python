#Algorithmic Thinking
"""
In a real life senario we can use the game of thinking about a number and
letting someone try to predict the number we are thinking about, for example,
the number can be between 1 and 10, both 1 and 10 included. The steps that they
would take to get the correct number might vary from person to person because 
some might use steps that would get them to the correct answer quicker than others.

Some might start guesing the numbers from the beginning 1 and progress by adding 1 until
they get the correct number while some might start from a number in the middle say 5 then
determine how close they are to the correct number and adjust there thinking.

The one which will take fewer steps to the get to the correct answer is the winner as it is
the most effective strategy.

That is what is called algorithmic thinking.
